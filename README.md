# Note Pad
##  A simple Python Tkinter GUI application for Managing Text Files
I've created a straightforward notepad application in Python using Tkinter. This Notepad GUI includes various menus such as "File" and "Edit." These menus provide functionality for tasks like saving files, opening files, and performing editing actions like cut and paste.
